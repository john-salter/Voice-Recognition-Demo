# Voice-Recognition-Demo
This is a barebones application I made to show off some voice recognition code I wrote in Java. 
This was modeled after a class project of one of my classmates.

This is still a work in progress, with lots of stuff left to do

TODO:
Implement the code to take the FFT of the inputs

Implement code to test new user against archive

Implement code which performs T-test on two frequency spectra to determine if they are statistically similar
